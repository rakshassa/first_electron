Connecting a postgres database

1. Install postgresql for windows
2. npm install pg
3. use PGAdmin4 to create a user, a database, and the tables.
	-- make sure your user has permissions to view/edit your database and tables.
4. Open a connection to the database
  const { Client } = require('pg')
  const client = new Client({
    user: 'electron_user',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'electron_db',
    password: 'fake_password',
    port: 5432
  })
5. Now you can query the database from javascript.


============================

Reading and writing the database from HTML

0.  include your script tags in the <head> of your index.html file.
		<script src="database.js"></script>
1.  Add your html form in index.html
2.  Map the onclick attribute of your form buttons to javascript methods.
		onclick="save_to_db();"
3.  In your javascript methods, read and write to the database.

===========================

to Test this example project:

1.  run it with npm start
2.  fill in the name and email fields and click "subscribe" -- now that user is saved in the database
3.  fill in the name field in the lookup section and click "lookup"  -- now that user's email should be auto-filled.
